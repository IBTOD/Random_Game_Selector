# Hello, Welcome to my random game selector. 

https://repl.it/@derekjshi/What-To-Play#main.py

This is a very basic program that will establish a list of any item (in this case it's video games) and select a random integer and pull the item at that index in the list.

This was a project built on establishing a basis in Object Oriented Programming, as well as "exception handling". Version 1 of this project had many potential code breaks that have
since been remediated. Some existing bugs still exist such as a typo not being recognized as the same game, or removing spaces leading a text entry.
