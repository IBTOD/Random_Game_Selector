# Hello, Welcome to my random game selector. 

https://repl.it/@derekjshi/What-To-Play#main.py

This is a very basic program that will establish a list of any item (in this case it's video games) and select a random integer and pull the item at that index in the list.

This was a project built on establishing a basis in Object Oriented Programming, as well as "exception handling". Version 1 of this project had many potential code breaks that have
since been remediated. Some existing bugs still exist such as a typo not being recognized as the same game, or removing spaces leading a text entry.



# Instructions
For the current program the functionality is limited to a preset list of items with the ability to add or remove items, and then finally have the program select an item. 

1. Launch the repl link: https://repl.it/@derekjshi/What-To-Play#main.py
2. Click the run button at the top 
3. Follow the instructions that appear in the console on the right side
4. To add an item to the list, type in a unique new item
5. To remove an item from the list, type the name of the item currently in the list that you would like to remove (This is case sensitive, the string must be identical) 
6. Once satisfied with the final list of items, type 'done' in the console
7. Play the game the random generator selected!
